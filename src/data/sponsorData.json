            "description": "Distributed Compute Labs is a Canadian educational nonprofit that aims to make computing power accessible for students and researchers worldwide by providing academic institutions with the Distributed Compute Protocol (DCP). DCP bridges the “compute divide” that results in power imbalances and inequality by leveling the playing field.  We believe that students, scientists, and researchers should have an abundance of compute power to push the envelope of innovation. By providing academic institutions with DCP, we ensure that students, researchers, and the future leaders of our world can overcome barriers to compute power to accelerate data science and advanced research computing.
