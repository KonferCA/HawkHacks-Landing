          <p>
            HawkHacks came out of a desire to give everyone an equal opportunity
            to get into tech, whether that be programming, networking,
            researching, learning, or teaching. Join hundreds of students across
            Canada (and across the world) in a 36 hour period of exploration,
            creativity, and learning!
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, you do not have to be a pro to participate - show up with
            ten years or ten minutes of experience (oh yeah, and a great
            attitude as well!)

          <h1>Our Goals</h1>
          <p>
            Our goal with HawkHacks is to showcase the amazing talent on display
            at our university. Often, smaller universities are outshun by bigger
            ones - we would like to change that, by showing how awesome of a
            community exists here too!
