                question: '🤔 What is a Hackathon?',
                answer: 'A hackathon consists of two “parts” - a social coding event where programmers, designers, and developers collaborate in teams to solve a problem. You can either create a software-based project that falls under a category hack or make whatever your heart desires as a general hack.\\n The second section is networking events, seminars, and presentations that happen throughout the hackathon conducted by industry and academic professionals - if you’ve been putting off learning that one programming language for a while, now might be the time to learn!',
