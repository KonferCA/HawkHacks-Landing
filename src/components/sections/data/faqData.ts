                question: '🤔 What is a Hackathon?',
                answer: 'A hackathon consists of two “parts” - a social coding event where programmers, designers, and developers collaborate in teams to solve a problem. You can either create a software-based project that falls under a category hack or make whatever your heart desires as a general hack.\\n The second section is networking events, seminars, and presentations that happen throughout the hackathon conducted by industry and academic professionals - if you’ve been putting off learning that one programming language for a while, now might be the time to learn!',

We\'ve lined up a bunch of events throughout the weekend that are all about boosting your career, soft skills, and tech skills. You\'ll get to hang out with industry professionals from academia, business, entrepreneurship - you name it. They\'re here to share their wisdom and insights, and maybe even teach you a thing or two.\\nAnd let\'s not forget the fun stuff! We\'ve got tons of mini-games and tournaments lined up, each with its own crazy prizes. Think of a spicy ramen challenge, a fast-typing tournament, and even a pizza-eating competition! It\'s all about having a blast while learning and connecting with awesome people.',
