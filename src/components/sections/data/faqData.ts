                question: 'ü§î What is a Hackathon?',
                answer: 'A hackathon consists of two ‚Äúparts‚Äù - a social coding event where teams of programmers, designers, and developers collaborate to solve a problem. You can either create a software-based project that falls under a category hack or make whatever your heart desires as a general hack.\\nThe second section involves networking events, seminars, and presentations conducted by industry and academic professionals. These mini-events are scheduled throughout the hackathon - they\'re completely optional, but are great ways to take a break from your hacking, and to even learn a new skill!',

We've lined up a bunch of events throughout the weekend that are all about boosting your career, soft skills, and tech skills. You'll get to hang out with industry professionals from academia, business, entrepreneurship - you name it. They're here to share their wisdom and insights, and maybe even teach you a thing or two.\\nAnd let's not forget the fun stuff! We've got tons of mini-games and tournaments lined up, each with its own crazy prizes. Think of a spicy ramen challenge, a fast-typing tournament, and even a pizza-eating competition! It's all about having a blast while learning and connecting with awesome people.",
