You can either create that falls under a category hack, or make whatever your heart desires as a general hack.", "The second section is networking events, seminars, and presentations that happen throughout the hackathon conducted by industry and academic professionals - if youâ€™ve been putting off learning that one programming language for a while, now might be the time to learn!"],
